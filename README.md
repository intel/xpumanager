# Intel(R) XPU Manager and XPU System Management Interface
Intel(R) XPU Manager is a free and open-source tool for monitoring and managing Intel data center GPUs.

It is designed to simplify administration, maximize reliability and uptime, and improve utilization.

XPU Manager can be used standalone through its command line interface (CLI) to manage GPUs locally, or through its RESTful APIs to manage GPUs remotely. Intel(R) XPU System Management Interface (XPU-SMI) is the daemon-less version of XPU Manager and it only provides the local interface. XPU-SMI feature scope is the subset of XPU Manager. Their features are listed in the table below. Please note that XPU-SMI and XPU Manager can't be installed or executed on the same system due to some resource conflict. XPU-SMI has been included in the GPU driver repository. If you want to use XPU Manager, please uninstall XPU-SMI and install XPU Manager. 

amcmcli is a portable CLI tool to manage GPU AMC firmware on Linux OS. It is independent of GPU driver. 

3rd party open-source and commercial workload and cluster managers, job schedulers, and monitoring solutions can also integrate the XPU Manager or XPU-SMI to manage Intel data center GPUs.

## Intel(R) XPU Manager features
* Administration:
	* GPU discovery and information - name, model, serial, stepping, location, frequency, memory capacity, firmware version
	* GPU topology and grouping
	* GPU Firmware updating, including GPU GFX firmware and AMC (Add-in card Management Controller) firmware updating. 
* Monitoring:
	* GPU telemetry – utilization, power, frequency, temperature, fabric speed, memory throughput, errors
	* GPU health – memory, power, temperature, fabric port, etc.
* Diagnostics:
	* 3 levels of GPU diagnostic tests
	* Pre-check GPU hardware and driver critical issues
	* GPU log collection for the issue investigation
* Configuration:
	* GPU Settings - GPU power limits, frequency range, standby mode, scheduler mode, ECC On/Off, performance factor, fabric port status
	* GPU policies - Throttle GPU when the temperature set threshold is reached 
* Supported Frameworks:
	* Prometheus exporter, Docker container support, Icinga plugin
